# Sleep-Stage-Classification-Using-MNE-Python-Library
Sleep stage classification plays an important role in the diagnosis of sleep-related diseases. Manual sleep stage scoring is a time-consuming task for sleep experts and is limited by inter-rater reliability. Therefore, we need an automated way for sleep stage scoring. Automated identification of sleep stages is a key step in the study of sleep disorders and sleep research. In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep stage annotation method using a single-channel EEG signal. MNE (a python library) was used for this purpose. Various Machine Learning models were applied on the data .The sleep stage classification methods will help in improving the study of sleep disorders and help the sleep specialists in accurate diagnosis.
